Aim :
To compare the existing courses offered online and ascertain the features they are offering. To develop an educational framework which will combine the benefits of these courses and provide practical learning of IoT with assessment and report generation.


Solution - STELA
We planned to build a smart Learning Environment(SLE), focussed on practical training and supporting following features
1. Teaching, Learning and Assessment (TLA supported)
2. Provide IOT training through access to remote hardware.
3. IoT kits will be shared among a large number of users through time slots which will be more  efficient than college labs.
4. Online Report Generation and track record for each student.
5. Accessible to everyone for free.
